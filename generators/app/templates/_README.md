# Pattern Lab Node - Grunt Edition - Starter Kit

This is a Pattern Lab project using the Node edition with a Grunt wrapper.


## Prerequisites

The Pattern Lab Node - Grunt Edition uses [Node](https://nodejs.org) for core processing, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage project dependencies, and [grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) to run tasks and interface with the core library. Node version 4 or higher suffices. You can follow the directions for [installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on the Node website if you haven't done so already. Installation of Node will include npm. It's also highly recommended that you [install grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) globally.


## Installation

Prior to installation, ensure that all prerequisites have been met. Then, to install this project on your system:

1. Download and unzip the compressed package, or clone the repo using `git clone`.

2. Then install all package dependencies with `npm install`.


## Using Pattern Lab

Pattern Lab allows you to create atomic design systems and website styleguides from the ground up. For more information on the Node version and/or Grunt edition of Pattern Lab, read the [Pattern Lab Docs](http://patternlab.io/docs), check out the [Grunt Edition](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-grunt) project on Github, and/or get more details on the [Pattern Lab Node Core](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node).

## Using Handlebars

[Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) is a semantic templating language that Pattern Lab uses to bind JSON data with template files in order to generate static HTML. For a complete guide on how to use Handlebars, read the [Handlebars documentation](https://handlebarsjs.com), refer to the [Handlebars API](https://handlebarsjs.com/reference.html), and/or check out the [Handlebars project on GitHub](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js#differences-between-handlebarsjs-and-mustache).
